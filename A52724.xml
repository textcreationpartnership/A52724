            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>JAMES a Priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all that love the Appearance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt every where, Grace and Peace be multiplied from God the Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; My dear Hearts, you whom the Lord hath manifeſted ſo much Love unto, as to call you out of Sin and Death, and the World, all the Delights and Pleaſures of the World, which Fades away, up to himſelf, where is Joy unſpeakable, Pleaſures and Riches that endure for Evermore. Dear Friends, Watch and be Sober, that you may hear the voice of your Beloved when he calleth, and let not the precious profers of the Love of God be tendred in vain; while you have an Ear open to the World, you cannot hear the Voice of God, ſo that you have been made to groan under it: How long have you been deceived by it, all your time promiſing Peace, Fulneſs, and Satisfaction; but have been brought to cry out of Oppreſſion and Deceit, and your Cries are come before the Lord of Sabbaths, who is your Reſt, and he is now appeared to Deliver you, and ſet you free from Bondage, that you may ſerve him alone. And now take heed of conſulting with your Old Maſter; hath the Lord been ſo Merciful unto you, as that he hath ſet your Faces out of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> towards the promiſed Land, Oh take heed of looking back, leſt you be taken
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64610:2"/>
Captive, and led back again, and ſo you come ſhort of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your Faith fail you, and ſo you come ſhort of the Promiſe, for Unbelief cannot enter into the Reſt; but you, Dear Friends, put on Reſolution, put on Strength, be Valiant for your Freedom, caſt off every Weight, follow your Captain the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who for the joy ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſed the Shame, and ſo enter'd into Reſt and Glory. Take heed of halting between God and the World; what agreement can there be, or what Peace, while you are Married to the World? Your thoughts turn in thither, and your are Adulterated from God, who gives you all good things, as ſo many tokens of his Love; hereby is the broken Language brought forth, and you cannot ſpeak the pure Language of the Land of Reſt. And while you give way to that in you, which leads you to look back to what is behind you; you keep your ſelves in the Wilderneſs and Darkneſs, and loſe your way, and know not where you are; Grieving the Holy Spirit of the Lord which hath appeared unto you, to Guide you: But (Oh Friends!) mind your Guide, and follow him; Ariſe, Shine, your Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is riſen upon you, the Night is far ſpent, the Day is at hand, even the Day of <hi>Sion's</hi> Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; Ariſe, come away all you that love her, come off from the World and Worldly things, come into the Life, lie no longer in Death and Dead things. Awake thou that Sleepeſt, and ſtand up from the Dead, that Chriſt may give thee Light: Come forth, come forth of all Created things, witneſs your Redemption from the World, that you are Redeemed from the Earth up to God, out of all Kindreds, Tongues, People and Nations, to Reign as Kings and Prieſts for Ever, above the World, Sin, and Death; Triumphing and Treading upon all that would take you Captive. This is the Day of your Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, own it with the Loſs of all Fading Pleaſures, make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all the World, this is the Day you waited for, even the Day of your Joy, but of the Worlds Sorrow: A Day of Blackneſs and Gloomineſs, a Day of Fear and Trouble to them that Oppreſs you; a Day wherein the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be Exalted, and all the Kingdoms and Powers of the Earth Shaken; a Day wherein the Lord will Avenge the Power of him that is too ſtrong for you: Rejoice, Rejoice ye Meek of the Earth, Shout for Joy ye poor Deſpiſed ones, whom your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

have troden upon, and have caſt you out, and you have been made their Mocking-ſtock for the Truths ſake, Sing and Rejoice, the Voice of a King is amongſt you, and he will Marry you to himſelf in Righteouſneſs, Purity and Holineſs, and will Rejoice over you, as a Bridegroom over the Bride, and you ſhall be for a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord, and a Royal Diadem in the hand of your God. O my dear Hearts, my deſire to God for you all, is, that you might come to ſee what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Riches is laid up for you in Jeſus Chriſt, which is hid from all Fleſh, neither can they ſee it who live after the Fleſh; and while they continue their Love to the World and Worldly things, they keep out the Manifeſtation of the Father's Love, for their Hearts cannot receive both: Now ſhew your ſelves Wiſe Men, chooſe that which is Eternal, here is Light and Life tendred you in Jeſus Chriſt, freely out of the Father's Love, freely receive Life and Love, and ſhew forth Life and Love to God again, by giving up to him all you have, and all you are for Chriſt's ſake, that ſo you may come to receive all again with Chriſt, who is the fulneſs of the Father's Love, and in him are all good things needful for this Life, and that which is to come, even the earneſt of your Inheritance, which none can take from you; which being received, you ſhall never hunger more, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Well-ſpring within, even the Witneſs of Eternal Life and Love; and as Chriſt Appears, who is our Life and Love, ſo ſhall Life and Love Appear, Spring, Bloſſom, and bring forth Fruit towards God and Man; that ſo being raiſed with him from Death and Dead Works, you may henceforth Live unto God, and being brought into Oneneſs with him, and Purity, and Holineſs, you may be one amongſt your ſelves, of one Heart and one Mind, ſpeaking one and the ſelf ſame thing, and having the ſame care one for another, as for your ſelves. And take heed that there be not in any of you, a Principle of Self-love, which will lead to Separation and Diviſion, caſting a ſtumbling block in the way of the Simple; and ſo they that are Weak may be Defiled and turned back into the World. And I beſeech you Brethren, that you mark them that once ſet their Faces towards <hi>Sion,</hi> but not being willing to deny the World, and take up the Croſs, have conſulted with Fleſh and Blood, and turned back into <hi>Egypt</hi> again; of ſuch take heed, knowing that the ſame Spirit that hath wrought in them Deceitfully, will not ceaſe to work

by them to Deceive others to maintain its own Kingdom; but you ſtanding faſt in the pure Light of Chriſt, ſhall ſee whither thoſe Return, and the cauſe of their Returnings, and that the end of ſuch is worſe than the beginning; but there will be ſuch, that they who are approved may be made manifeſt. But you my Brethren, be ye ſo far from following ſuch, that their falling away, may cauſe you to watch and ſearch by what Power you ſtand, and ſo a pure fear may be preſerved in you, by which you may be kept in the way that leads to the Crown which is Immortal: For it is he that overcomes that muſt wear the Crown, wherefore faint not, nor think any thing hard the Lord calls you unto, nothing muſt Suffer but that which is to Die, that your Souls may Live: Oh your light Affliction worketh for you a far more exceeding weight of Glory, while you keep your Eye to that which is Inviſible! wherefore give up your ſelves to his will in all things: Stand in the will of God in your preſent Condition, you are my joy in the Lord; let my bowels be refreſhed to hear of your Stedfaſtneſs and Growth in the Truth: Take heed of propounding ends to your ſelves in any thing, for that leads out of the way of God, and gives way to your own Wiſdom; and ſo you ſeek to preſerve that Alive which is appointed for Death, and ſo you maintain War againſt God, and know it not; and in this condition you can have no Peace, while the Enemies are in Arms againſt your Peace. Oh! dear Friends, you are in my Heart, my Prayer to God for you is, that you may be kept blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, bleſſed for Ever. My fellow Priſoner, and dear Companion in the Lord Salutes you <note place="margin">F. H.</note> all: Ceaſe not to Pray for us, that we may be kept to his Praiſe, who hath counted us worthy to Suffer for his Name, we are well and in great Peace, kept in our Father's Love above all; we are often brought to ſtand and wonder how we are kept in the midſt of the Fire, and not Conſumed; and the more that the Enemy Rages, the more are we kept in Peace within: Here are ſtrange Devices uſed to inſnare us, to get ought againſt us (true or falſe) but all is ordered by a power the World knows not, God is our Strength; Rejoice with us all, dear Friends, and Praiſe his Name for Evermore, for he is worthy, for his Mercy endures for Ever.</p>
